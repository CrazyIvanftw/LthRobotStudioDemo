Ok, here's what you need to do to be able to run LthRobotStudio things or to reporduce the demo. 
I think it's probably better if you download the actual LthRobotStudio repository into a 
Vistual Studio solution and build these dll files from there, but you might be pressed for time.

1) If nod building from Visual Studio -> These files need to be put into the RobotStudio bin files. 
From this folder, copy the files:

Google.ProtocolBuffers.dll
Google.ProtocolBuffers.Serialization.dll
EgmFramework.dll
EgmMessgaeProtocols.dll

into the RobotStudio folders: Bin and Bin64

On my machine, the RobotStudio folders were at: 
C:\Program Files (x86)\ABB Industrial IT\Robotics IT\RobotStudio 6.07\Bin
C:\Program Files (x86)\ABB Industrial IT\Robotics IT\RobotStudio 6.07\Bin64


2) If building from Visual Studio -> Where I found these files on my machine after building the 
Visual Studio solution 'LthRobotStudio':

C:\Users\<user>\.nuget\packages\google.protocolbuffers\2.4.1.555\tools\Google.ProtocolBuffers.dll
C:\Users\<user>\.nuget\packages\google.protocolbuffers\2.4.1.555\tools\Google.ProtocolBuffers.Serialization.dll
C:\Users\<user>\source\repos\LthRobotStudio\EgmFramework\bin\Debug\netstandard2.0\EgmFramework.dll
C:\Users\<user>\source\repos\LthRobotStudio\EgmFramework\bin\Debug\netstandard2.0\EgmMessgaeProtocols.dll
